    <h3>Top 4 Innovative EdTech Companies</h3>
    <p id="top5item"><span><a href="#">Outschool</a></span>
        For making remote learning fun
        
        Outschool, founded in 2015, is a marketplace for virtual extracurriculars, such as ukulele lessons and food-science experiments, for students ages 3 to 18. For working parents, those activities have become a pandemic lifeline: Outschool sign-ups went from 80,000 to 1.6 million between March and October; lessons cost as little as $5, from one-offs to weekly sessions.</p>
        <p id="top5item"><span><a href="#">Ruangguru</a></span>
            For livestreaming school for free to 10 million students during lockdown. Last March, less than a week after Indonesia closed schools for its 50 million–plus students, Jakartabased edtech startup Ruangguru launched a free 18-channel, livestreamed online school. It rocketed to the top of the app store charts, thanks to the company’s well-honed approach to engaging kids: teachers with on-screen expertise, fun animations, careful storyboarding, and interactive polls. Indonesian student achievement has lagged compared to its Asian neighbors, but Ruangguru aims to prevent the pandemic from widening those gaps. “It’s our responsibility to always innovate,” says cofounder and CEO Adamas Belva Syah Devara.</p>
        <p id="top5item"><span><a href="£">SkillShare</a></span>
            For giving creatives and hobbyists a pandemic outlet

            One of the first platforms for video-based lessons, Skillshare has hit its stride as a learning community for more than 12 million users, 3 million of whom joined in the past year. During the pandemic, subscribers have been choosing from among 30,000 classes on subjects such as watercolor painting and photography, plus a new slate of live classes, and interest from enterprise customers has quadrupled.
        </p>
        <p id="top5item"><span><a href="#">Tonies</a></span>
            Popular in Europe, the Toniebox is an alternative to Alexa for parents looking for audio storytelling without an e-commerce link. Germany-based Tonies sells its brightly colored Toniebox smart speakers alongside collectible action figures, encouraging listeners ages 3 and older to play imaginatively. To date, the company has sold 1.7 million Tonieboxes; it launched in the U.S. last year.
