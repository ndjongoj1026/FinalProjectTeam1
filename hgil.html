    <p>We have acronyms like LOL (laughing out loud), RN (right now) BRB (be right back) and the pandemic of the 21st century inspired a new acronym. WFH better known as Work From Home. Professionals and many organizations became very aware of this acronym as they creatively pivoted their respective work and businesses in an effort to reduce the spread of the infectious COVID-19 virus.</p>
    <p>To date, COVID-19 has taken eight hundred thousand lives in the United States alone with deaths to continue for the foreseeable future.  As of December 2021, a new strain discovered by South African scientist known as the Omicron variant promises to be more transmissible and infectious. For the sake of employee safety and continued operation, businesses and organizations must respond accordingly by deferring or delaying the return to work from the office.</p>
