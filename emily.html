        <div><p>When 2020 hit, we were not expecting what the year had in store for us. Many of us were not prepared for the devastation that happened during the Covid 19 pandemic. One of the many outcomes we were not expecting was the loss of so many jobs due to social distancing. Many restaurants and small businesses were subsequently shut down because of what had happened with covid. Either because of social distancing or workers becoming sick from the virus.</p></div>

        <div><p>Many individuals lost their jobs or had to find out how to adjust to their current jobs. Many jobs had to implement COVID safety into their companies, but many also ended up closing down because there was suddenly no market for their company. Some places included adding social distancing and mask requirements to their work sites. Other companies became online. Some companies could not integrate into the current problems concerning COVID and ended up not existing.</p></div>

        <div><p>There are many resources to help individuals find jobs in our current job market. These include government sites and job search sites such as Indeed. Many job options are available online, meaning an individual could work from home instead of an office depending on the work.</p></div>
